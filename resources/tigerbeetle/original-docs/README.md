# TigerBeetle

This is the documentation for TigerBeetle: the financial transactions database designed for mission
critical safety and performance to power the next 30 years of [OLTP](./concepts/oltp.md).

This is how the entire documentation is organized:

- [Start](./start.md) gets you up and running with a cluster.
- [Concepts](./concepts/) explains why TigerBeetle exists.
- [Coding](./coding/) shows how to integrate TigerBeetle into your application.
- [Operating](./operating/) covers deployment and operating a TigerBeetle cluster.
- [Reference](./reference/) is a companion to [Coding](./coding/) which meticulously documents every
  detail.

Note that this documentation is aimed at the users of TigerBeetle. If you want to understand how it
works under the hood, check out the [internals docs](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/tree/main/docs/internals).
