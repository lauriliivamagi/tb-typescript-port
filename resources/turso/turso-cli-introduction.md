## Turso CLI - Introduction

The Turso CLI gives you everything you need from the command line to manage your database, API tokens, inviting users, and launching the database shell. If you’re waiting for a migration to run, there’s also a relax command.
You can also programmatically manage your Turso account, including groups, databases, organizations and invites using the Platform API.
